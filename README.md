# Pipes

A web-based remake of the Windows 3D Pipes screensaver (3D Pipes.scr) using [Three.js](https://threejs.org/)

Mouse button | Action
--- | ---
Primary | Change view and go full screen
Secondary | Clear pipes and restart

Includes both Utah Teapots and candy cane easter eggs! (with increased chances üòè)

## TODO

* Expose options in the UI (and save to local storage)

* Show mouse controls in the UI (hidden when going full screen save as the "Fork me on GitHub" ribbon)

* Different joint types

* Are the pipes are supposed to change between different behaviors,
like long pipes, maybe following other pipes, and short winding pipes?

* Use a disolve effect when clearing

* Add icon to this README and favicon (also add a title to the page!)
